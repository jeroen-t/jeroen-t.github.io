We are going to set up the Git repository (repo) for our module. Click on your profile in the top right of the page. A menu will open. Click on Your repositories. We are going to create a new repository so click on New. Provide a meaningful name for your repository. I provided the name of the module I created. Optionally you can give a description for you repository as well. Another decision you will have to make is whether you want your repository publicly visible or not. Set your repo to either: Public: Anyone on the internet can see this repository. You choose who can commit. Private: You choose who can see and commit to this repository. You can always change this in the settings of your repository later as well. Additionaly you can select whether you want to initialize your repository with a README file, a .gitignore file and a license. Once you have provided all the necessary information press the button Create repository at the bottom of the page. 🎈 Congrats on your Repo! 🎉 Now go back to the page that lists all your repositories and open the repository that you have just created. There should be a green button named Code. Press that button and copy the provided URL. Open PowerShell on your machine and browse to your working folder. For this example I am using my home directory. cd $home clone your Repository by running the following command: git clone https://github.com/\u003cusername\u003e/\u003crepository\u003e.git replace the URL with the one you have copied earlier.

Actually, mine should get some love! 😅 The .github and build_scripts folders can be ignored for now. We will cover this later once we start working on our pipeline. For now create a directory with the name of your module. This is where we are going to create our module and manifest files for our PowerShell module. Within the directory we just created, create another folder with the name functions. This is where we are going to place all our functions.

If you are new to functions have a look at this documentation. It might sound intimidating at first but it is a really straight forward process. Maybe you already have a script available that you might want to turn into a function (because you are using running that script quite often now that you think of it 🤔). Give it a shot! And if you don’t have anything existing yet try to come up with something and try doing it with PowerShell. I found myself looking at the Azure ARM template documentation quite often but usually need to only have a quick look for reference. So I thought maybe I can create a function that will just return the ARM (or Bicep) template from the docs onto my terminal window. So it doesn’t have to be revolutionary just try something that sounds useful to you. Dive in. That is how we learn 👍 Once you have created your function save them in the .\\functions\\ folder.

Add a theme for your siteBefore we can start deploying our site we need to pick a theme. There are a lot of which you can choose from https://themes.gohugo.io/. I am using the uBlogger theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/ublogger/). Once you have found your theme you will have to install it.\\ You can either download a zip file of the latest release of the theme and extract it in the themes directory, clone the themes GitHub repository to theme directory directly or create an empty git repository and make it a submodule of your site directory. I went with the latter. Now let’s change directory to our new site folder, create an empty git repository and download and add our new theme as a subdirectory. We do this by running: cd sitefolder git init git submodule add https://github.com/upagge/uBlogger.git themes/uBlogger Now that we have our theme we can add it as a default to our configuration file. In our sites directory we need to make some changes to the config.toml file to achieve this. So open the file in VS Code: code .\\config.toml And add these settings to the site configuration: # Default theme Theme = \"uBlogger\" [params] # uBlogger theme version Version = \"2.0.X\" Save the config.toml file and open your terminal again. From your site directory run: hugo serve Once the build succeeds the web server will be available at http://localhost:1313/ Open this site in your browser (ctrl + click in terminal to open).

Sweet! 😍 But what if we want to publish new content? We have learned how to create a new post. # set site as working directory cd sitefolder # create a new hugo post hugo new posts\\new-post.md # edit your post in vs code code .\\content\\posts\\new-post.md # and save.. # check locally if we achieved the desired result hugo serve # open http://localhost:1313/ in your browser # ctrl + C to exit When we are happy with our newly created content then we can build the static pages using the hugo command. Followed by pushing our static pages in the public folder to our GitHub repo. # build static pages hugo # or if including drafts: hugo -D # change the to the public directory cd ./public git add . git commit -m \"commit\" git push origin master That’s it! Now if we refresh our site it should contain the newly created content. Have fun! 👍 ","date":"19-06-2021","objectID":"/2021/06/site-setup/:4:0","tags":["Blog","Setup","GitHub Pages"],"title":"How to create a website using Hugo and GitHub Pages","uri":"/2021/06/site-setup/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"whoami","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"EXPERIENCE","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:1:0","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Deloitte | Azure Cloud EngineerJuly 2021 - Present ","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:1:1","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Deloitte | SQL DBA Azure EngineerMarch 2019 - Present ","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:1:2","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Deloitte | SQL Database AdministratorSeptember 2018 - March 2019 ","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:1:3","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Didacticum Groep | SQL DBA TraineeJuly 2018 - March 2019 ","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:1:4","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Education","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:2:0","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences2013 - 2018 Bachelor of Science (BSc.), Mathematical Engineer Certifications \u0026 Exams\r\r\r\r","date":"18-06-2021","objectID":"/about/:2:1","tags":["Career"],"title":"About Me","uri":"/about/"}]
