If you are interested in doing the same you should create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one. They have a free plan available and the process is straight forward. Just go to their site to sign up. 3. Visual Studio CodeI highly suggest using a code editor. My editor of choice is Visual Studio Code. To install VS Code run: choco install vscode And of course if you prefer a different editor yourself than you can use that one instead.

Create a site folderBefore we start let us create a directory in which our Hugo sites will be stored. For this demo I will use create a Hugo folder on C:. cd C:\\; mkdir Hugo | cd The command below will create a new Hugo site in a folder named “sitefolder” in the current directory. If you want it to be created in a different location then change your working directory to the desired location. You can specify a name other than “sitefolder” by just replacing it to whatever you like. hugo new site sitefolder ","date":"19-06-2021","objectID":"/2021/06/site-setup/:2:1","tags":["Blog","Setup","GitHub Pages"],"title":"How to create a website using Hugo and GitHub Pages","uri":"/2021/06/site-setup/"},{"categories":["Documentation"],"content":"2. Add a theme for your siteBefore we can start deploying our site we need to pick a theme. There are a lot of which you can choose from https://themes.gohugo.io/. I am using the uBlogger theme (https://themes.gohugo.io/ublogger/). Once you have found your theme you will have to install it.\\ You can either download a zip file of the latest release of the theme and extract it in the themes directory, clone the themes GitHub repository to theme directory directly or create an empty git repository and make it a submodule of your site directory. I went with the latter. Now let’s change directory to our new site folder, create an empty git repository and download and add our new theme as a subdirectory. We do this by running: cd sitefolder git init git submodule add https://github.com/upagge/uBlogger.git themes/uBlogger Now that we have our theme we can add it as a default to our configuration file. In our sites directory we need to make some changes to the config.toml file to achieve this. So open the file in VS Code: code .\\config.toml And add these settings to the site configuration: # Default theme Theme = \"uBlogger\" [params] # uBlogger theme version Version = \"2.0.X\" Save the config.toml file and open your terminal again. From your site directory run: hugo serve Once the build succeeds the web server will be available at http://localhost:1313/ Open this site in your browser (ctrl + click in terminal to open). It is empty as of now but this is what we got as of now. You can leave your terminal open and make changes to the config or any content files. Any changes made will immediately reflect on the page.

Some more theme changesOur site as of now is still looking a bit empty.. time to change that. First we will have to make some changes to the configuration. We can have a peak at the sample site of our theme which is listed in the exampleSite folder of our themes directory. But the uBlogger theme also has a default configuration in their documentation. Which I am going to use for now. baseURL = \"http://example.org/\" # [en, zh-cn, fr, ...] determines default content language defaultContentLanguage = \"en\" # language code languageCode = \"en\" title = \"My New Hugo Site\" # Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo theme = \"uBlogger\" [params] # uBlogger theme version version = \"2.0.X\" [menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \"posts\" # you can add extra information before the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons pre = \"\" # you can add extra information after the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons post = \"\" name = \"Posts\" url = \"/posts/\" # title will be shown when you hover on this menu link title = \"\" weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"tags\" pre = \"\" post = \"\" name = \"Tags\" url = \"/tags/\" title = \"\" weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \"categories\" pre = \"\" post = \"\" name = \"Categories\" url = \"/categories/\" title = \"\" weight = 3 # Markup related configuration in Hugo [markup] # Syntax Highlighting (https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting) [markup.highlight] # false is a necessary configuration noClasses = false Edit the config.toml file in our sites directory and paste this big chunk of config stuff in there. Before we start making more edits lets save the file and have a look at our site now. http://localhost:1313/ in case you closed your browser. Or if you have exit PowerShell run: hugo serve keep it running.. it is nice to see what is happening. Well, after changing the config we got a menu even a light/dark mode button. Neat!
